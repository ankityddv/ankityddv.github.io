                        These days, you see gradient meshes in a lot of places from the Instagram app icon to the Framer website and find implementations for Sketch, Figma and of course Illustrator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conceptually, gradient meshes generalize linear gradients by interpolating between colors that can be placed along two dimensions on a plane.

                    <p>
                        But we don't want to limit ourselves to displaying pre-exported assets. To make your apps truly responsive and to dynamically react to changes in color and user preference, we need to be able to generate these gradient meshes on the fly.
